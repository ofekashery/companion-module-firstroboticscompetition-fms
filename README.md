# companion-module-firstroboticscompetition-fms

This Bitfocus Companion module provides easy control over the visual output at _FIRST_ Robotics Competition events. It communicates with the Field Management System (FMS) to switch between different displays modes shown on the Audience Display.

See [HELP.md](./companion/HELP.md) for more information.

## Getting started

Executing a `npm install` command should perform all necessary steps to develop the module, if it does not then follow the steps below.

The module can be built once with `npm run build`. This should be enough to get the module to be loadable by companion.

While developing the module, by using `npm run dev` the compiler will be run in watch mode to recompile the files on change.
